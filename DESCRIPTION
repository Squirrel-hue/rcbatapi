Description: Implements authorization and other functions to trade crypto using 
    the Coinbase Advanced Trading API.  There is a general function that permits
    accessing of API endpoints, as well as functions that assist with the order 
    endpoints.
    This package is offered as is without any promise or guarantee of suitability
    for any given purpose.  Test it out with small quantities of currency.
    When this code was originally written, to the best of my knowledge there was 
    no Coinbase Advanced Trading Sandbox.  There now seems to be this option for 
    accounts and orders endpoints, so it is recommended that this users avail 
    themselves of these options for testing (see 
    <https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/docs/rest-api-sandbox>).
